                    <br>
                    Disruptive technologies are innovations capable of transforming existing industries 
                    and established workflows. These technologies introduce new features or methods that 
                    are capable of outperforming existing solutions, if widely adopted. Inventions like 
                    electricity, the Internet, and–most recently–Artificial Intelligence (AI) are examples 
                    of disruptive technologies. History has proven that disruptions are not always negative 
                    but will this be the case for AI ChatBots?

                        The Power of AI: A Disruptive Force
                    </h3>
                    <br>
                        AI’s vast potential is apparent in its many forms: 
                        interactive AI (e.g. chatbots), functional AI (e.g. proofreading tools), 
                        visual AI (e.g. image recognition). These applications demonstrate AI’s 
                        transformative capabilities. As a disruptive technology, it replaces 
                        traditional and existing systems in business, healthcare, travel, and 
                        countless other industries. 
                    <br><br>
                        AI chatbots simulate human conversations and, in professional assistive 
                        contexts, can be used from customer service rolls to mental health support. 
                        As defined by Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), AI is “a computer program 
                        that simulates and processes human conversation (either written or spoken, 
                        allowing humans to interact with digital devices as if they were communicating 
                        with a real person.” AI chatbots are capable of emulating human support and 
                        providing general health diagnostics. These chatbots used advanced algorithms 
                        such as deep learning to understand and respond to a user’s concerns and 
                        self-observations.

                        Accessing Mental Health Services
                    </h3>
                    <br>
                        There are many factors that can impact a person’s mental 
                        health: emotional skills, substance abuse, poverty, and 
                        inequality (WHO, 2022). Mental illnesses can vary from 
                        different conditions in severity (NIH, n.d.) and impact a 
                        person’s well-being and quality of life.
                    <br><br>
                        A recent large-scale study co-led by Harvard Medical School 
                        and University of Queensland predict that by the age of 75 years old, 
                        one in two individuals will develop at least one mental health disorder 
                        (McGraft et al., 2023). In the same study, it was found that depressive 
                        disorders were still the most prevalent among their respondents alongside 
                        alcohol use disorder (McGraft et al., 2023). To make matters worse, 
                        according to the World Health Organization (WHO), over 150 million people 
                        in the European Region are currently living with a mental health condition. 
                        The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated this crisis, limiting access to 
                        services and increasing stress levels. 
                    <br><br>
                        Given these challenges, traditional mental health services are highly 
                        recommended for those who can afford it. The services typically involve 
                        in-person counseling, therapy sessions, or psychiatric consultations. 
                        These services are provided by licensed professionals such as psychologists, 
                        psychiatrists, or therapists who offer  personalized treatment plans, talk 
                        therapy, and medication management when necessary. However, it’s no secret 
                        that not everyone has the financial capability to afford it.
                    <br><br>
                        Traditional mental health providers have embraced online 
                        platforms to increase accessibility. A few examples include:
                    <br><br>
                    <li><b>BetterHelp: </b>Offers online therapy with licensed counselors via video calls, messaging, and live chats.</li>
                    <li><b>Talkspace: </b>Provides therapy sessions tailored to individual needs, including specialized programs for couples or teens.</li>
                    <li><b>Cerebral: </b>Focuses on mental health treatment with a subscription-based model that combines therapy and medication management.</li>

            AI automation extends to customer support for mental health services. These systems 
            streamline appointment scheduling, answer frequently asked questions, and ensure 
            seamless communication between users and mental health providers.
            <br> <br>
            By integrating traditional and AI-driven approaches, the mental health sector 
            will be able to deliver more inclusive, accessible, and effective care. AI 
            companions like Character AI and Replika can provide conversational support, 
            but they lack the depth and expertise of a trained therapist. Despite these 
            limitations, AI-powered tools are ever-developing.

            <li>According to a study published in the National Institutes of Health's National 
            Library of Medicine (NLM), there's a growing need for specialized support for 
            young people experiencing depression and anxiety. Notably, a 2-week intervention 
            using a chatbot demonstrated effectiveness in reducing these symptoms, compared to 
            a control group receiving self-help materials.</li>

            are rising in popularity due to their ability to simulate empathetic conversations. 
            By employing techniques such as CBT, chatbots are able to help users manage stressors 
            in real-time with guided self-help tools, immediate availability, privacy, and anonymity 
            which are often points of worry and stigmatized.
            <br><br>
            However, AI chatbots like these still need to be further researched on the efficacy 
            of agent-guided CBT outside of English, particularly in nuanced languages wherein words 
            change depending on sentence structure. This finding underscores the importance of language-specific 
            considerations when developing and evaluating AI-powered mental health interventions.

                    mental disorders received no treatment. Even the small fraction of 
                    people with access to mental health care potentially receives poor 
                    quality care according to WHO Mental Health Atlas 2011 due to 
                    scarcity and inequitable distribution of resources. 
                <br> <br>
                    More significantly, there is a huge insufficiency of mental health workers, 
                    especially in low to middle income countries. In half of the world’s population, 
                    there is only an average of one psychiatrist for every 200,000 people, and there 
                    are even less personnels trained to provide psychosocial interventions 
                    (Tahira, 2024).

                <br>
                    Mental health has been long stigmatized not only because of societal preconceptions, 
                    but also due to inaccessibility in terms of financial availability. The sudden 
                    prevalence of AI technologies led to the integration of AI chatbots in numerous 
                    softwares, applications, and even websites to improve user experience and faster 
                    chat response time.

                <br> <br>
                    AI chatbots may encourage deep self-disclosure for individuals who may hesitate to 
                    share intimate details about themselves. A study conducted by Lee et al. (2020) suggests t
                    hat AI chatbots may be able to help mental health professionals (MHP) to understand people’s 
                    mental status through deeper self-disclosure, and to establish a deeper trust between the MHP 
                    and the subjects. This was possible due to the capability of conversational agents (CA) in 
                    satisfying the emotional needs of students. The results of a study conducted by Kim et al. 
                    (n.d.) noted that CAs are attentive listeners due to their lack of emotions, protect private 
                    information, and give unbiased advice based on the provided data.

                <br><br>
                    Apart from this, AI chatbots provide effective assistance to specific needs 
                    of various demographics, as they provide quick and useful responses. The 
                    technology optimizes workload, and facilitates tasks that would otherwise 
                    require human intervention (Følstad & Brandtzaeg, 2020). Such efficiency for 
                    users is beneficial in many aspects, including customer service and general 
                    contexts. With this efficiency in mind, AI chatbot capabilities can be 
                    improved in numerous aspects, such as learning engagement among students. 
                    New and efficient technologies like AI chatbots have influenced students’ 
                    interests and learning capability, indicating that AI chatbots can serve as 
                    effective tools in enhancing learning engagement (Lee et al., 2022). Alongside that, 
                    numerous students utilize AI chatbots for thinking development, knowledge acquisition, 
                    and motivation enhancement—AI chatbots provide support to students academically, 
                    optimizing learning and positively impacting cognitive performance (Ma et al., 2024). 

                <br><br>
                    Nonetheless, poor data produces a poor AI model. If an AI chatbot’s model is 
                    not trained properly and well, AI chatbots can perpetuate biases present in 
                    their training data. This remains a constant challenge for many generative 
                    AI models (Niloy et al., 2024). In lieu of such concerns with AI chatbots, 
                    they can also provide inaccurate or misleading information, which can be a 
                    concern for information-sensitive workfields (Perrone, 2024).
                <br><br>
                    Furthermore, AI chatbots are prone to misinterpretation of prompts; 
                    users may receive irrelevant responses that deviate from their expectations 
                    (Følstad & Brandtzaeg, 2020). Alongside that, AI chatbots can simulate conversation, 
                    but lack the depth and context in natural human interaction. Such limitations could pose 
                    challenges in context such as mental health support and emotional intelligence 
                    (Perrone, 2024). This proves a need to improve natural language processing (NLP) 
                    models and capabilities.

                <u>Accessibility and Affordability</u>
             </h4>

                 <br>
                 One way AI chatbots are disruptive is by breaking down barriers to accessibility. 
                 In a study by Devillers (2021), a significant development is the creation of 
                 "companion robots" (or chatbots) that assist patients with disabilities by providing 
                 therapy or tracking their health over time. These robots are especially helpful for 
                 individuals with conditions like Alzheimer's or other brain diseases, as they can offer
                care 24/7 with patience and without tiring. Additionally, traditional therapy and medical 
                consultations are often expensive, time-consuming, or hard to access due to location. 
                AI chatbots, however, provide quick, 24/7 assistance at a much lower cost, making it easier 
                for more people to receive mental health and medical advice. This change enables more people to 
                get the help they need without the usual barriers of time or cost.
                <br> <br>
                The state of mental healthcare as often expensive or inaccessible, especially to minorities, 
                is recognizable. Habicht, et al. (2024) conducted a study to prove the potential of digital tools, 
                “personalized artificial intelligence-enabled self-referral chatbot”, in bridging the accessibility 
                gap of mental healthcare. The study found a significant increase (15%)  in referrals was found, particularly 
                in minority groups such as nonbinary (179%)  and ethnic (29%)  individuals. The study reported that 
                the patients' recognition of needing help and the chatbot's human-free nature were the drivers for 
                encouraging more diverse groups, based on qualitative feedback from 42,332 individuals (Habicht, 
                et al., 2024).

                </h4>
   
                <br>
                In a study titled "An Overview of Chatbot-Based Mobile Mental Health Apps: 
                Insights From App Descriptions and User Reviews" by Haque et al. (2023), the 
                results of their study concluded that people liked chatting with bots because they 
                felt personal and friendly. Since bots are always available, some people might start 
                relying on them more than talking to friends and family. The bots created a safe space 
                where people felt comfortable sharing personal or sensitive information without being 
                judged. Mental health is often stigmatized, making people hesitant to seek help. 
                Chatbots offer a safe, anonymous space for users to share their feelings without judgment.
                
                <br> <br>
                According to a study published in JMIR Mental Health (Forbat et al., 2017), a 
                conversational agent named Woebot was designed to deliver basic CBT principles 
                through brief, daily interactions within a messaging app. Each interaction began 
                by assessing mood and context, then presented core CBT concepts through videos or 
                interactive exercises. Woebot employed a decision-tree framework to guide 
                conversations, with predetermined responses and limited natural language 
                processing for user input.

                <br><br>
                In need of an active listener to have emotional conversations, AI chatbots are an option 
                to consider. SimSimi is a widely used open-domain social chatbot. It differs from other 
                notable chatbots (Woebot, Youper, etc.) as it is not intentionally designed to support 
                mental health conditions, but rather to flexibly discuss anything. In a study by Chin, 
                et al. (2023), they analyzed more than 150,000 conversation utterances in SimSimi, with 
                specified keywords such as “depressed” and “sad”. They aimed to identify how the AI 
                chatbot facilitates sadness and depressive moods of the users and the cultural differences 
                in the expression of such emotion among Western (Canada, the United Kingdom, and the 
                United States) and Eastern countries  (Indonesia, India, Malaysia, the Philippines, and 
                Thailand).

                Among their findings, 18.24% of the analyzed conversations of users regarded the 
                chatbot as a social actor, empathizing with or comforting the chatbot. 
                With the users feeling emotional support from the chatbot and identifying it as a 
                virtual nonhuman partner, it allowed them to openly engage in emotional discourse and 
                express sadness. This is further proven through a comparison of their findings with a 
                previous study in 2017 that analyzed the public discussion of depression on Twitter 
                (now known as “X”) where the researchers discovered a higher prevalence of conversations
                about sadness in chatbots (49.83%) than on Twitter (7.53%) (Chin, et al., 2023).

                Students commonly face various stressors that can impact their mental health which 
                may then also impact their academic performance.  Abot is an AI chatbot designed to 
                encourage students in lifestyle habits and well-being. A research by Sia, et al., 
                (2021) involved 25 senior high school students using Abot for a week to investigate 
                students’ acceptability and perceived effectiveness on their well-being. The evaluation 
                based on the average scores using a 4-point Likert scale was 3.35 on performance, 
                3.36 on humanity, and 3.68 on effect, contributing to the potential of AI chatbots as 
                tools to assist students in managing their mental health.

                    <u>Risks</u>
                </h4>

                <br>
                It is important to note that although AI chatbots may help monitor and pose as a guide to 
                one’s self-management of their mental health, it is unable to replace human mental health 
                professionals and their services. This notion is, according to Khawaja and Bélisle-Pipon 
                (2023), is a “kind of therapeutic misconception” where being unaware of or confusing the 
                role of these chatbots may imply an individual underestimating the restrictions and 
                limitations of AI chatbots while overestimating its ability to provide therapeutic support 
                and guidance.  These misconceptions may be formed due to “inaccurate marketing of such 
                chatbots, forming a digital therapeutic alliance with these chatbots, inadequate design of 
                the chatbots leading to biases, and potentially limiting one's autonomy” 
                (Khawaja and Bélisle-Pipon, 2023). 

                <br> <br>
                The manner of communication with an AI chatbot is mainly performed through an exchange 
                of texts, a conversation.  However, AI chatbots are nonhuman and so, are unable 
                to develop the same meaningful therapeutic alliance as human mental health 
                professionals can with their patients.  It may feel as if there is a connection 
                of sorts between user and chatbot, similar to a study found in which users 
                described their experience with Woebot, stating they thought of the chatbot 
                showing concern for them (Khawaja & Bélisle-Pipon, 2023; Darcy, et al., 2021). 
                But it is misleading as users may believe this bond is real.

                It risks therapeutic misconception as they may trust the chatbot with their 
                sensitive information and therapeutic services without human intervention 
                (Khawaja & Bélisle-Pipon, 2023). This risk can pose further risks in the 
                long-term in providing ineffective and inaccurate advice or, in bleaker cases, 
                negatively impacting a user’s mental health. Though applications or the chatbot 
                itself may give reminders of or encourage its users to receive formal therapy, 
                this effort may not be sufficient to avoid therapeutic misconception.

                        Limitations and Ethical Considerations
                    </h3> 
                    <br>
                        AI chatbots have experienced significant growth in various sectors, including 
                        customer service and mental health support. However, their rapid integration 
                        comes with fundamental limitations that need ethical considerations, particularly 
                        in addressing users' emotional and diagnostic needs.

                    <u>Challenges in Diagnostics</u>
                </h4>
        
                    <br>
                        AI chatbots take into account various data from across varying sources to make an 
                        informed decision. However, due to this, there is a likelihood that due to the 
                        vast database an AI chatbot has to sort through, it has the potential of making 
                        a misdiagnosis.  In this case, it runs the risk of potentially making a diagnosis 
                        that is not well-accustomed to the beliefs of its users. For example, a user who 
                        grew up in a conservative family might get the wrong implications from the diagnosis 
                        of the AI chatbot who did not take into account the upbringing of its user.

                    Their reliance on datasets and algorithms limits their capacity to 
                    build trust, de-escalate emotional situations, or provide effective psychotherapy as 
                    they cannot engage in discursive practices or guide users toward self-understanding 
                    (Sedlakova & Trachel, 2022). This empathy gap  can delay users from seeking professional help, 
                    potentially worsening their condition. Additionally, anthropomorphism bias, wherein users mistakenly 
                    attribute human-like compassion to chatbots, raises ethical concerns. Halls (2023) 
                    highlights how human interaction, even a single meaningful connection daily, 
                    improves well-being—something that AI cannot replicate. Developers bear ethical 
                    responsibility to clarify AI’s limitations in emotional support, as misleading 
                    users may lead to misplaced trust and harm (AI & Society, 2020).

                    <u>Data Privacy and Identity Theft Risks in AI Chatbots</u>
                </h4>
        
                    <br>
                    In line with this, the issue of data privacy always comes up when 
                    dealing with AI chatbots. Usually, most applications or websites which 
                    use AI chatbots ask users to create an account with them. This runs the risk 
                    of individuals’ identity being stolen or otherwise used for other nefarious reasons. 
                    In 2023 for example, the Philippines saw a 13.9% increase in cyber-identity theft 
                    cases compared to 2022 (Tupas, 2024).  This proves how easy it is for a person’s 
                    identity to be stolen, and this risk itself carries over in the use of chatbots. 
                    It is for this reason that it is essential for applications and websites which 
                    use AI chatbots to have transparency to their users with regards to how they use the 
                    user’s information.

                       Conclusions
                   </h3> 
                   <br>
                    AI, as innovative and as helpful in bridging gaps in emotional and 
                    diagnostic support, and accessibility, still has limitations and room 
                    for improvement much like other new and developing technologies.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                        The lack of human empathy and understanding of nuance poses a significant 
                        drawback in handling emotionally sensitive situations and diagnostics. 
                        As AI’s development continues, it becomes essential to address its limitations 
                        through ethical design and clearer parameters. This approach ensures that chatbot 
                        usage can meaningfully enhance, rather than undermine, mental health support as 
                        an auxiliary tool to human solutions.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                        Until this becomes a standard rather than a possibility, human 
                        intervention and further research is necessary.
