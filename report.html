                        What is Disruptive Technologies?

                    <br>
                    Disruptive technologies are innovations capable of transforming existing industries 
                    and established workflows. These technologies introduce new features or methods that 
                    are capable of outperforming existing solutions, if widely adopted. Inventions like 
                    electricity, the Internet, and–most recently–Artificial Intelligence (AI) are examples 
                    of disruptive technologies. History has proven that disruptions are not always negative 
                    but will this be the case for AI ChatBots?

                                    AI’s vast potential is apparent in its many forms: interactive AI (e.g. chatbots), functional AI (e.g. proofreading tools), visual AI (e.g. image recognition). These applications demonstrate AI’s transformative capabilities. As a disruptive technology, it replaces traditional and existing systems in business, healthcare, travel, and countless other industries. 
                                    <br>
                                    AI chatbots simulate human conversations and, in professional assistive contexts, can be used from customer service rolls to mental health support. As defined by Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), AI is “a computer program that simulates and processes human conversation (either written or spoken, allowing humans to interact with digital devices as if they were communicating with a real person.” AI chatbots are capable of emulating human support and providing general health diagnostics. These chatbots used advanced algorithms such as deep learning to understand and respond to a user’s concerns and self-observations.

            AI automation extends to customer support for mental health services. These systems 
            streamline appointment scheduling, answer frequently asked questions, and ensure 
            seamless communication between users and mental health providers.
            <br> <br>
            By integrating traditional and AI-driven approaches, the mental health sector 
            will be able to deliver more inclusive, accessible, and effective care. AI 
            companions like Character AI and Replika can provide conversational support, 
            but they lack the depth and expertise of a trained therapist. Despite these 
            limitations, AI-powered tools are ever-developing.
            <br> <br>
            According to a study published in the National Institutes of Health's National 
            Library of Medicine (NLM), there's a growing need for specialized support for 
            young people experiencing depression and anxiety. Notably, a 2-week intervention 
            using a chatbot demonstrated effectiveness in reducing these symptoms, compared to 
            a control group receiving self-help materials.

            <u><a href="https://www.youper.ai/">Youper, </a></u>

            <u><a href="https://getmarlee.com">Marlee </a></u>
            are rising in popularity due to their ability to simulate empathetic conversations. 
            By employing techniques such as CBT, chatbots are able to help users manage stressors 
            in real-time with guided self-help tools, immediate availability, privacy, and anonymity 
            which are often points of worry and stigmatized.
            <br><br>
            However, AI chatbots like these still need to be further researched on the efficacy 
            of agent-guided CBT outside of English, particularly in nuanced languages wherein words 
            change depending on sentence structure. This finding underscores the importance of language-specific 
            considerations when developing and evaluating AI-powered mental health interventions.

                Accessibility and Affordability
             </h4>

                 <br>
                 One way AI chatbots are disruptive is by breaking down barriers to accessibility. 
                 In a study by Devillers (2021), a significant development is the creation of 
                 "companion robots" (or chatbots) that assist patients with disabilities by providing 
                 therapy or tracking their health over time. These robots are especially helpful for 
                 individuals with conditions like Alzheimer's or other brain diseases, as they can offer
                care 24/7 with patience and without tiring. Additionally, traditional therapy and medical 
                consultations are often expensive, time-consuming, or hard to access due to location. 
                AI chatbots, however, provide quick, 24/7 assistance at a much lower cost, making it easier 
                for more people to receive mental health and medical advice. This change enables more people to 
                get the help they need without the usual barriers of time or cost.
                <br> <br>
                The state of mental healthcare as often expensive or inaccessible, especially to minorities, 
                is recognizable. Habicht, et al. (2024) conducted a study to prove the potential of digital tools, 
                “personalized artificial intelligence-enabled self-referral chatbot”, in bridging the accessibility 
                gap of mental healthcare. The study found a significant increase (15%)  in referrals was found, particularly 
                in minority groups such as nonbinary (179%)  and ethnic (29%)  individuals. The study reported that 
                the patients' recognition of needing help and the chatbot's human-free nature were the drivers for 
                encouraging more diverse groups, based on qualitative feedback from 42,332 individuals (Habicht, 
                et al., 2024).

                    Emotional and Behavioral Impact
                </h4>
   
                <br>
                In a study titled "An Overview of Chatbot-Based Mobile Mental Health Apps: 
                Insights From App Descriptions and User Reviews" by Haque et al. (2023), the 
                results of their study concluded that people liked chatting with bots because they 
                felt personal and friendly. Since bots are always available, some people might start 
                relying on them more than talking to friends and family. The bots created a safe space 
                where people felt comfortable sharing personal or sensitive information without being 
                judged. Mental health is often stigmatized, making people hesitant to seek help. 
                Chatbots offer a safe, anonymous space for users to share their feelings without judgment.
                
                <br> <br>
                According to a study published in JMIR Mental Health (Forbat et al., 2017), a 
                conversational agent named Woebot was designed to deliver basic CBT principles 
                through brief, daily interactions within a messaging app. Each interaction began 
                by assessing mood and context, then presented core CBT concepts through videos or 
                interactive exercises. Woebot employed a decision-tree framework to guide 
                conversations, with predetermined responses and limited natural language 
                processing for user input.

                <br><br>
                In need of an active listener to have emotional conversations, AI chatbots are an option 
                to consider. SimSimi is a widely used open-domain social chatbot. It differs from other 
                notable chatbots (Woebot, Youper, etc.) as it is not intentionally designed to support 
                mental health conditions, but rather to flexibly discuss anything. In a study by Chin, 
                et al. (2023), they analyzed more than 150,000 conversation utterances in SimSimi, with 
                specified keywords such as “depressed” and “sad”. They aimed to identify how the AI 
                chatbot facilitates sadness and depressive moods of the users and the cultural differences 
                in the expression of such emotion among Western (Canada, the United Kingdom, and the 
                United States) and Eastern countries  (Indonesia, India, Malaysia, the Philippines, and 
                Thailand).

                Among their findings, 18.24% of the analyzed conversations of users regarded the 
                chatbot as a social actor, empathizing with or comforting the chatbot. 
                With the users feeling emotional support from the chatbot and identifying it as a 
                virtual nonhuman partner, it allowed them to openly engage in emotional discourse and 
                express sadness. This is further proven through a comparison of their findings with a 
                previous study in 2017 that analyzed the public discussion of depression on Twitter 
                (now known as “X”) where the researchers discovered a higher prevalence of conversations
                about sadness in chatbots (49.83%) than on Twitter (7.53%) (Chin, et al., 2023).

                Students commonly face various stressors that can impact their mental health which 
                may then also impact their academic performance.  Abot is an AI chatbot designed to 
                encourage students in lifestyle habits and well-being. A research by Sia, et al., 
                (2021) involved 25 senior high school students using Abot for a week to investigate 
                students’ acceptability and perceived effectiveness on their well-being. The evaluation 
                based on the average scores using a 4-point Likert scale was 3.35 on performance, 
                3.36 on humanity, and 3.68 on effect, contributing to the potential of AI chatbots as 
                tools to assist students in managing their mental health.

                </h4>

                <br>
                It is important to note that although AI chatbots may help monitor and pose as a guide to 
                one’s self-management of their mental health, it is unable to replace human mental health 
                professionals and their services. This notion is, according to Khawaja and Bélisle-Pipon 
                (2023), is a “kind of therapeutic misconception” where being unaware of or confusing the 
                role of these chatbots may imply an individual underestimating the restrictions and 
                limitations of AI chatbots while overestimating its ability to provide therapeutic support 
                and guidance.  These misconceptions may be formed due to “inaccurate marketing of such 
                chatbots, forming a digital therapeutic alliance with these chatbots, inadequate design of 
                the chatbots leading to biases, and potentially limiting one's autonomy” 
                (Khawaja and Bélisle-Pipon, 2023).

                It risks therapeutic misconception as they may trust the chatbot with their 
                sensitive information and therapeutic services without human intervention 
                (Khawaja & Bélisle-Pipon, 2023). This risk can pose further risks in the 
                long-term in providing ineffective and inaccurate advice or, in bleaker cases, 
                negatively impacting a user’s mental health. Though applications or the chatbot 
                itself may give reminders of or encourage its users to receive formal therapy, 
                this effort may not be sufficient to avoid therapeutic misconception.

                                AI chatbots lack the ability to perceive, interpret, and 
                                respond to complex emotions, making them unable to replicate 
                                genuine human interactions and to detect subtle, non-verbal cues.

                    AI automation extends to customer support for mental health services. These systems 
                    streamline appointment scheduling, answer frequently asked questions, and ensure 
                    seamless communication between users and mental health providers.
                <br> <br>
                    By integrating traditional and AI-driven approaches, the mental health sector 
                    will be able to deliver more inclusive, accessible, and effective care. AI 
                    companions like Character AI and Replika can provide conversational support, 
                    but they lack the depth and expertise of a trained therapist. Despite these 
                    limitations, AI-powered tools are ever-developing.

                    According to a study published in the National Institutes of Health's National 
                    Library of Medicine (NLM), there's a growing need for specialized support for 
                    young people experiencing depression and anxiety. Notably, a 2-week intervention 
                    using a chatbot demonstrated effectiveness in reducing these symptoms, compared to 
                    a control group receiving self-help materials.
